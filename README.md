#Newsly
##Tindr for news, except it actually learns what you like.


###What is Newsly? 
####(The non-techical version)

	"In a world where both our to-do lists and our news feeds are constantly overflowing, nobody should have to spend their time trawling media outlets to find what they want. Newsly came together at TechCrunch Disrupt Hackathon EU as a result of our collective interests: mastering Node.js (or getting part way there), experimenting with machine learning APIs and finding a way to quickly and easily find news that is of interest to you. With an impressive and intuitive UI and a simple but powerful concept powering its personalised aggregation of content, Newsly learns preferences of any busy individual who wants to stay updated on the things that they are interested in." - Davit, Dwi and Zahra.
